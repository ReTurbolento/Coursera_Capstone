Actually the society is located in a small building in the suburbs of Milan, which is way too small and it does not give the image of an uprising company.\n\nThe company's board finally decided to move to a new house and they commit us to find a proper location. They want a location that is easy to reach for clients coming from other cities and which is enjoyable for workers, either in terms of public transport and attractions close to the new office. Obviously they want to pick the best option from an economical point of view but this aspect must not prevail with respects to the others. In shorts, hereby we summarize the points we must take into account into our analysis:\n\n1- Presence of Train station nearby the new office \\\n2- Presence of Metro or bus station nearby the new office \\\n3- Meter square office cost (â‚¬/M2) \\\n4- Level of pub/resteraunts around the office \\\n5- Presence of parks around the office ","metadata":{},"id":"63f630d5-ce56-4959-a281-16f3b9cf525b"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Projet Summary\nOur office has been identified by company's board as the best to individuate the perfect location for the new office. We have then design the different phases of the \ndecision process as different phases of a single project, which will have the goal of find out the best borough of the city where to search for the new office building. The idea is also to guarantee replicability of the model, so that it can be refreshed if conditions changes in the next months and it can be used even within the single borough to sort different locations according to the same principles defined in previous paragraph. Hereby a synthesis of different phasese:\n\n#### 1- Data collection\nWe are going to build a dataframe in which we will store each borough geo-position and some information like their average house price. Our sources will be free database available on the web. \n\nOnce this base dataframe is finisched, we are going to add information about most important venues of each borough. To do so we are going to use foursquare and we are going to query it using Api\n\n#### 2- Data analysis\nIn this phase we are going to give a statistical description of each feature of the dataset, in order to identify peculiarities or anomalies and eventually fix them. \n\n#### 3- Borough sorting\nThis will be the phase when we build a model to compare different boroughs. In particolar we are going to define a \"Suitability Scores\" which is going to describe percentually how suitable is each borough with respect to board's requests for the new offices location\n\n#### 4- Replicability and model usage\nAfter showing the results of our analysis we are also going to explain how our model is replicable and which will be the suggested following action to be taken in order to find the best nes offices for our company.\n","metadata":{},"id":"84ab7fa6-c169-46bf-a455-34044d9dabed"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"cc3ceb5c-919a-4411-869c-7b0d30d98377"}]}
